It is\n                challenging due to the nonlinear temporal dynamics with changing complex factors and the inherent\n                difficulties in long-scale predictions. Conventional models often lack efficient information\n                extraction\n                and cannot meet the requirements of long-scale predictions. Therefore, the gate recurrent unit (GRU)\n                encoder–decoder with SST codes and dynamic influence link (DIL), GRU encoder– decoder (GED), which\n                considered both the static and dynamic influence, is proposed in this letter. Each SST code,\n                capturing\n                the static information more effectively, was computed by all hidden states of the encoder and was\n                individually associated with each predicted SST. The DIL, capturing the dynamic influence, connected\n                the\n                SST code with the early predicted future SST for solving the long-scale dependence problem. GED was\n                tested on the Bohai Sea SST data sets and South China Sea SST data sets and compared with\n                full-connected\n                long-short term memory (FC-LSTM) and support vector regression. The results demonstrated that GED\n                outperformed others on different prediction scales and different prediction terms (daily, weekly,\n                and\n                monthly), especially in terms of long-scale and long-term predictions. In addition, attention\n                relationships between historical and future SSTs were further explored, and there was a meaningful\n                finding that each future daily mean SST of Bohai Sea most strongly correlated with the past 27th to\n                29th\n                historical values.\n            ")]),t("h3",[e._v("PAPER")]),t("el-link",{attrs:{type:"primary",underline:!1,href:"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8859"}},[e._v("\n                download\n            ")]),t("h3",[e._v("DATASETS")]),t("el-link",{attrs:{type:"primary",underline:!1,href:"https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JUrdsMYZrYRMItN4F18xtQ"}},[e._v("\n                download\n            ")]),t("h3",[e._v("CODES")]),t("el-link",{attrs:{type:"primary",underline:!1,href:""}},[e._v("\n                download\n            ")]),t("h3",[e._v("README")]),t("el-link",{attrs:{type:"primary",underline:!1,href:""}},[e._v("\n                download\n            ")])],1)],1)],1)},i=[],r={name:"ged",data:function(){return{}}},o=r,d=t("2877"),l=Object(d["a"])(o,a,i,!1,null,null,null);n["default"]=l.exports}}]);
